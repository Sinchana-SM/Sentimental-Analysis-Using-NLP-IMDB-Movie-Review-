**Data set -kaggle datasets download -d lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews**
This project is a sentiment analysis web application designed to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. Utilizing a robust machine learning pipeline, the project involves data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. The application is built with Python, leveraging the NLTK library for text processing and scikit-learn for model training. The frontend is developed using Streamlit, providing an intuitive interface for users to input reviews and receive sentiment predictions. The project demonstrates key concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, from data cleaning and vectorization using TF-IDF to classification with a Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC). The model is saved using pickle for efficient deployment. This application serves as a practical example of how machine learning can be applied to understand and analyze textual data, making it a valuable tool for gaining insights into customer feedback and sentiment.
